# Sahar's dbt Learning Notes

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ 

This repo is basically my personal collection of dbt notes, templates, and little how-tos. If you're diving into dbt like me, you'll find folders here on how to set up a dbt project, some example YAML files, and notes on models, tests, seeds, snapshots, and more.

Think of it as a friendly little knowledge base to help me (and maybe you!) keep things straight. Feel free to explore and use anything here if it helps. Happy modeling! âœ¨
