# Sahar's dbt Learning Notes

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ 

This repo is basically my personal collection of dbt notes, templates, and little how-tos. If you're diving into dbt like me, you'll find folders here on how to set up a dbt project, some example YAML files, and notes on models, tests, seeds, snapshots, and more.I am using dbt fusion. 


## ðŸ“‚ Repo Structure
- `models/` â†’ notes, examples, performance + cost optimization tips  
- `tests/` â†’ generic vs. custom tests, best practices  
- `seeds/` â†’ seed file examples and configs  
- `snapshots/` â†’ how to track slowly changing dimensions  
- `macros/` â†’ macro examples and patterns  
- `dbt_commands/` â†’ CLI commands cheat sheet  
- `setup_dbt_project/` â†’ step-by-step dbt setup (with dbt-fusion) 


Think of it as a friendly little knowledge base to help me (and maybe you!) keep things straight. Feel free to explore and use anything here if it helps. Happy modeling! âœ¨
